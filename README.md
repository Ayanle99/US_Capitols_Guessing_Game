# US_Capitols_Guessing_Game

This is a simple java swing GUI that tests you on U.S capitols. The GUI show a horizontal menu at the top containing all 50 states. When you click on of them, the program will show you a question asking you that state's capitol name. It gives you four options, and if you guess it right, you get a point, otherwise you get no points.
